As an intern, I was asked to turn two PDF files into interactive HTML web pages. More specifically, I made all the images in the PDF files enlarge on mouse hover. And they would enlarge toward the center of the window so that no matter how the user hovers over an image, the enlarged version will always be entirely visible.
